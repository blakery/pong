#What is this?

It's pong, or at least a clone of it.

This is a remake of a class project from about 2 years back. The original 
was both lost (or at least buried deep enough in archives that remaking it is
probably easier), and in straight C (rather than C++). 


#Why am I bothering?

Mostly to brush up on C++. The Scope is about right for it, and I don't feel like
tracking down the original anyway.


#Other Stuff

Uses the ncurses library, so you need that to compile. The Makefile uses g++,
so you'll need that, too. Other than that, it should run out of the box on 
most Linux distros.
