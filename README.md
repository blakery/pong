This is a C++ remake of a class project from about 2 years back. The original 
was both lost (or at least buried deep enough in archives that remaking it is
probably easier), and in straight C. 

It's pong, or at least a clone of it.

Uses the ncurses library, so you need that to compile. The Makefile uses g++,
so you'll need that, too. Other than that, it should run out of the box on 
most Linux distros.
